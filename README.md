Hospital Management Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of key hospital management metrics, focusing on patient care, resource utilization, and operational efficiency. The goal is to empower hospital administrators and staff with data-driven insights to improve patient outcomes, manage resources efficiently, and optimize hospital performance.

Features
Patient Care Analysis: Visualizations that track patient admissions, discharges, and average length of stay, segmented by department and patient demographics.
Resource Utilization: Insights into bed occupancy rates, staff allocation, and equipment usage across different departments.
Financial Performance: Breakdown of hospital revenue streams, expenses, and profit margins, with a focus on cost management.
Patient Satisfaction Metrics: Analysis of patient feedback and satisfaction surveys to gauge the quality of care and identify areas for improvement.
Emergency Room (ER) Analysis: Detailed metrics on ER wait times, patient volumes, and treatment outcomes.
Data Sources
The analysis is based on anonymized hospital management data, including:

Patient admission and discharge records
Departmental resource usage (staff, equipment, and beds)
Financial data (revenue, costs, insurance claims)
Patient feedback and satisfaction scores
Emergency department logs
Key Insights
Patient Flow: A high volume of patients is concentrated in the emergency and cardiology departments, with an average stay of 3-4 days per patient.
Bed Occupancy: The hospitalâ€™s bed occupancy rate is above 85%, indicating high utilization, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Revenue Breakdown: Insurance claims contribute to 70% of total revenue, with the remaining 30% from out-of-pocket payments.
Satisfaction Trends: High patient satisfaction is noted in departments such as pediatrics and orthopedics, while areas like ER could benefit from reduced wait times.
Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard development.
SQL: For data extraction and manipulation.
Excel: For preliminary data processing and cleanup.
